# React App Builder

Create React app in specified location with components without React boilerplate.

## Description

A React app is created at the specified location, with all specified components created and imported. Each component will be created in it's own sub-directory of the 'component' directory. A .jsx and .css file is created for each component.

An index.css is created using [Andy Bell's CSS Reset]("https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421")

This Python code is a bit messy but it works :)
